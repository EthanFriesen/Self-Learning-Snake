# Self Learning Snake

## Description

This program uses a simple machine learning algorithm with a genetic algorithm where a neural network learns how to play the game of snake.

It works by simulating generations of neural networks that all play the game of snake and are scored. Those neural networks then "mate" with eachother with some random mutations thrown in to create the next generation. This process is repeated and the neural networks get higher and higher scores, essentially "learning" how to play the game of snake.

## Usage

This is a console application. Clone this repository locally and compile it with dotnet and then run the program. Alternitavely, you can run the program in a webpage here: [](https://replit.com/@Lumpylump/Snake-Neural-Network).
